                <h5>Stack</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dominant</li>
                    <li>Auxilliry</li>

                <h5>Dominant</h5>
                According to Jung, people use all four cognitive functions. However, one function is generally used in a more conscious and confident way. This dominant function is supported by the secondary (auxiliary) function, and to a lesser degree the tertiary function. The fourth and least conscious function is always the opposite of the dominant function. Myers called this inferior function the "shadow".
                The four functions operate in conjunction with the attitudes (extraversion and introversion). Each function is used in either an extraverted or introverted way. A person whose dominant function is extraverted intuition, for example, uses intuition very differently from someone whose dominant function is introverted intuition.
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
                <h5>Auxilliry</h5>
                Each personality type uses two of the available function pairs in its functional stack. As we’ve seen, INTPs’ dominant function is Ti. Since we know Ti is always paired with Fe, we know that INTPs must also have Fe in their functional stack. In the same way, knowing that INTPs use Ne, we also know that they use Si. Hence, by memorizing the function pairs it is easier to remember (or deduce) the functional stack for each type (e.g., if you know that INTPs use Ti and Ne, you can deduce that they use Si and Fe).
                But why is Fe considered to be INTPs’ inferior function, instead of, say, their auxiliary or tertiary function?
                In large part, we know the relative “strength” of each function through the inner experience of the types. For instance, INTPs’ know, from within, that F is their weakest or “missing” function. They find it very difficult to contact their feelings and emotions (the same is true for types with a dominant F function with respect to T, those with dominant N with respect to S, or those with dominant S with respect to N). We also know that INTPs are quite comfortable and skilled with using Ne, which is why it is considered their auxiliary function.
                Therefore, the functional stack cannot only be discerned theoretically (e.g., Ti and Fe are theoretical opposites), but also by understanding the degree to which each type experiences or exhibits strength with a given function.
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-3">
                <h5>Tertiary</h5>
                If you want to create a super simple character, give them only the two dominant functions. Many cartoon personas have two distinct functions, but you can't see much evidence of the third or fourth. The supporting functions come in and make the character more "human". What is a Te-dom bad guy with no sensitive Fi? Or a an ISFJ heroine with no Ti? Flat, that's what they are.
                A person's third function often works hand in hand with their second. Because stacks are always JPPJ or PJJP, the middle functions are either both judging or both perceiving. They're like a married couple, or those two awesome kid brothers that you see working together in like, every movie.
                The third function also serves as the brakes. Let's say an INTP (Ti, Ne, Si, Fe) is invited to spontaneously go to the beach with their friends. Their Ne might get excited, but their Si is quick to quietly remind them, "Remember last time we went to the beach? The sand made you itchy for 17 hours, and there was no wifi. Are you sure you want to go?" Beckett says that his Si doesn't just remind him of the last time he went to the beach, it reminds him of every time he's ever been to the beach.
                The third function can also provide relief, or a "way out". For an ESTJ (Te, Si, Ne, Fi) their Si might be quite comfortable doing the same thing again and again, but their Ne says, "Hey, what about this new idea! We could do it differently!" While their Si is faithfully trudging on with daily life, their Ne helps give them vision for the future and see new possibilities. For me, my Ni (third function) figuratively pats me on the shoulder and says, "It's okay if we don't understand everything concretely. Sometimes things just don't make sense."
                The third function doesn't control or lead, but offers its strength and support to the functions above it.
